### Hi there üëã
[–ü–æ-—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏](/Russian.md)

Certified Python developer with 3+ years of experience. Well acquainted with database engineering, data processing and Python web frameworks. I can design a backend for a scalable and fault-tolerant application, visualize a dataset or automate document workflow. As a self-starter I am constantly advancing my skills on my own time in addition to bootcamp training.

I dream of joining a team of professionals to work hard on non-trivial challenges
